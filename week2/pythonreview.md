# Python review

### Review the Python interpreter!
What happens when you run the following lines of code in a Python interpreter? Write down your answers for these on a piece of paper.

```python
>>> print("Hello World") #1
>>> print(Hello World) #2
>>> 4 * 2 #3
>>> 4 / 2 #4
>>> 3 / 2 #5
>>> interns = ['Ava', 'Crystal', 'Elena', 'Odelia', 'Renee', 'Stephanie']
>>> interns[0] #6
>>> interns[1] #7
>>> interns[6] #8
>>> interns + 'Carolyn' #9
>>> interns + ['Carolyn'] #10
```

### Defining functions

Write your solutions in Sublime Text or any other text editor of your choosing.

1. Write a function named `square` that returns the square of any number.

2. Write a function named `favorite_color` that, given the name of any of the herp interns, returns their favorite color as a string. (You will have to ask your fellow interns for this information!)

3. Write a function named `reverse` that, given a Python list, returns the reverse of the list. Ex: Given x = [1, 2, 3, 4], reverse(x) will return [4, 3, 2, 1].
